    <h4>In a nutshell</h4>
    <p style="width: 500px;">How do you squish 30 years of life into an elevator pitch? üòÖ 
        Let‚Äôs narrow it down to simply who I am today. Today I‚Äôm someone who is passionate 
        about sustainable development and equality. I work towards these goals daily by 
        taking part in global efforts to make education inclusive & accessible to all. My 
        niche spot in the bigger picture lies behind the scenes, working on tools and processes 
        that can help us all get there (delivering and receiving education) better, faster, and 
        in a more resilient way.</p>
    <h4>Career highlights</h4>
    <p style="width: 500px;">Over the past 5 years, I‚Äôve experienced flow while writing and editing 
        content used for digital learning, documentation of products and processes, marketing, and 
        professional training. As a result, I've had a bird's-eye view of two key areas: pedagogy and 
        internal operations. I‚Äôve also enjoyed working with project management, product onboarding - both 
        on-site & online, and the optimization of internal processes. These experiences have taught 
        me the importance of good time & self-management, decision-making, teamwork, and design 
        thinking. Knowing that I'm directly contributing to the bigger picture, one task at a time, 
        is my rocket fuel. And sharing in success with my peers and colleagues gives me life!</p>
    <h4>Studies at Hive</h4>
    <p style="width: 500px;">Thanks to the 42 curriculum that we follow at Hive, I am most proficient 
        at programming algorithms in C. The project-based, peer-to-peer style of studying at Hive has 
        also helped me learn the basic best practices of programming, code structure, and command-line 
        arguments. This is currently where I feel most at home, but I‚Äôm also branching out into other 
        areas of programming - fast!</p>
    <h4>Web Development</h4>
    <p style="width: 500px;">Web is where it‚Äôs at! 59% of the world‚Äôs population was online in 2020. 
        I‚Äôm currently working on bringing my knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL up to 
        speed by working on personal projects. I plan on exploring Python, MongoDB, and APIs soon.</p>
    <h4>Data</h4>
    <p style="width: 500px;">One thing I absolutely love about coding is using it to pick needles out 
        of haystacks! ü§ì It‚Äôs been estimated that there was more than 5,000 GB of data per person on 
        Earth in 2020 - a sizable portion of that being personal data. That‚Äôs one big ass haystack! 
        While some may focus on how they could use this data to sell products, or give a particular 
        politician an electoral advantage, I want to focus on how we can use data to help people better 
        their lives on their own terms.</p>
    <h4>Optimization & automation</h4>
    <p style="width: 500px;">It‚Äôs time to level up! When you have a team that consists of the best and 
        the brightest, the last thing they should be doing is manually updating excel sheets. It‚Äôs my 
        belief that we really harness our individual human potential whenever we engage in meaningful 
        work. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm currently learning how to build automation scripts with the help of 
        APIs - for myself, and others!</p>
    <h4>EdTech to TechEd</h4>
    <p style="width: 500px;">I have mostly worked as a content editor for companies that focus on using 
        technology to help deliver education. Now I‚Äôm ready to take that effort to the next level: helping 
        to further develop technology to make education more inclusive and available to the world. World 
        Economic Forum recently listed the most sought-after skills to have by 2025. It is my opinion that 
        all of these skills can be built through programming! That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs one of my personal goals to 
        help make technology more approachable through education -  encouraging everyone, no matter what 
        their background might be, to explore all the possibilities that learning programming can unlock.</p>
