            <p class="txt_light left_textarea">How do you squish 30 years of life into an elevator pitch? 
            Let’s narrow it down to simply who I am today. Today I’m someone who is passionate 
            about sustainable development and equality. I work towards these goals daily by 
            taking part in global efforts to make education inclusive and accessible to all. My 
            niche spot in the bigger picture lies behind the scenes, working on tools and processes 
            that can help us all get there in a better, faster, and more resilient way.</p>

            <h2 class="right_textarea">Career Highlights</h2>
            <p class="txt_light right_textarea">Over the past five years, I’ve experienced flow while writing and editing 
            content used for digital learning, documentation of products and processes, marketing, and 
            professional training. I’ve also enjoyed working with project management, product onboarding
            - both on-site and online, and the optimization of internal processes. These experiences have 
            taught me the importance of good time and self-management, decision-making, teamwork, and design 
            thinking. Knowing that I'm contributing to the bigger picture, one task at a time, 
            is my rocket fuel. And sharing in success with my peers and colleagues gives me life!</p>

        <div class="sub_hive">
            <h2 class="txt_dark left_textarea">Studies at Hive</h2>
            <p class="txt_dark left_textarea">Thanks to the 42 curriculum that we follow at Hive, I'm most proficient 
            at programming algorithms in C. The project-based, peer-to-peer style of studying at Hive has 
            also helped me learn the basic best practices of programming, code structure, and command-line 
            arguments. This is currently where I feel most at home, but I’m also branching out into other 
            areas of programming - fast!</p>

        <div class="sub_data">
            <h2 class="right_textarea">Web Development & Data</h2>
            <p class="txt_light right_textarea">Web is where it’s at! 59% of the world’s population was online in 2020. 
            I’m currently working on HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL through personal projects. 
            I also plan on exploring Python, MongoDB, and APIs soon. One thing I absolutely love about coding is using it to pick needles out 
            of haystacks! It’s been estimated that there was more than 5,000 GB of data per person on 
            Earth in 2020 - a sizable portion of that being personal data. That’s one big ass haystack! 
            While some may focus on how they could use this data to sell products, or give a particular 
            politician an electoral advantage, I want to focus on how we can use data to help people better 
            their lives on their own terms.</p>

            <h2 class="left_textarea">Optimization & Automation</h2>
            <p class="txt_light left_textarea">It’s time to level up! When you are part of a team that consists of the best 
            and the brightest, the last thing they should be doing is manually updating excel sheets. It’s my 
            belief that we really harness our individual human potential whenever we engage in meaningful 
            work. That’s why I’m currently learning how to build automation scripts with the help of 
            APIs - for myself, and for others!</p>

        <div class="sub_edu">
            <h2 class="txt_dark right_textarea">EdTech to TechEd</h2>
            <p class="txt_dark right_textarea">This far, I have mostly worked as a content editor for companies that focus on using 
            technology to help deliver education. Now I’m ready to take that effort to the next level: helping 
            to further develop technology to make education more inclusive and globally available. World 
            Economic Forum recently listed the most sought-after skills to have by 2025. It's my opinion that 
            all of these skills can be built through programming! That’s why it’s one of my personal goals to 
            help make technology more approachable through education -  encouraging everyone, no matter what 
            their background might be, to explore all the possibilities that learning programming can unlock.</p>
