        <h4>In a Nutshell</h4>
        <p>How do you squish 30 years of life into an elevator pitch? ðŸ˜…  
            Letâ€™s narrow it down to simply who I am today. Today Iâ€™m someone who is passionate 
        about sustainable development and equality. I work towards these goals daily by 
        taking part in global efforts to make education inclusive and accessible to all. My 
        niche spot in the bigger picture lies behind the scenes, working on tools and processes 
        that can help us all get there in a better, faster, and more resilient way.</p>

        <h4>Career Highlights</h4>
        <p>Over the past five years, Iâ€™ve experienced flow while writing and editing 
            content used for digital learning, documentation of products and processes, marketing, and 
            professional training. Iâ€™ve also enjoyed working with project management, product onboarding
            - both on-site and online, and the optimization of internal processes. These experiences have 
            taught me the importance of good time and self-management, decision-making, teamwork, and design 
            thinking. Knowing that I'm contributing to the bigger picture, one task at a time, 
            is my rocket fuel. And sharing in success with my peers and colleagues gives me life!</p>

        <h4>Studies at Hive</h4>
        <p>Thanks to the 42 curriculum that we follow at Hive, I'm most proficient 
            at programming algorithms in C. The project-based, peer-to-peer style of studying at Hive has 
            also helped me learn the basic best practices of programming, code structure, and command-line 
            arguments. This is currently where I feel most at home, but Iâ€™m also branching out into other 
            areas of programming - fast!</p>

        <h4>Web Development</h4>
        <p>Web is where itâ€™s at! 59% of the worldâ€™s population was online in 2020. 
            Iâ€™m currently working on HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL through personal projects. 
        I also plan on exploring Python, MongoDB, and APIs soon. ðŸ¤“</p>

    <div class="red">
        <h4>Data</h4>
        <p>One thing I absolutely love about coding is using it to pick needles out 
        of haystacks! Itâ€™s been estimated that there was more than 5,000 GB of data per person on 
        Earth in 2020 - a sizable portion of that being personal data. Thatâ€™s one big ass haystack! 
        While some may focus on how they could use this data to sell products, or give a particular 
        politician an electoral advantage, I want to focus on how we can use data to help people better 
        their lives on their own terms.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="yellow">
        <h4>Optimization & Automation</h4>
        <p>Itâ€™s time to level up! When you are part of a team that consists of the best 
            and the brightest, the last thing they should be doing is manually updating excel sheets. Itâ€™s my 
        belief that we really harness our individual human potential whenever we engage in meaningful 
        work. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m currently learning how to build automation scripts with the help of 
        APIs - for myself, and for others!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="aqua">
        <h4>EdTech to TechEd</h4>
        <p>This far, I have mostly worked as a content editor for companies that focus on using 
            technology to help deliver education. Now Iâ€™m ready to take that effort to the next level: helping 
            to further develop technology to make education more inclusive and globally available. World 
        Economic Forum recently listed the most sought-after skills to have by 2025. It's my opinion that 
        all of these skills can be built through programming! Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s one of my personal goals to 
        help make technology more approachable through education -  encouraging everyone, no matter what 
        their background might be, to explore all the possibilities that learning programming can unlock.</p>
