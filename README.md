# HTML_Personal_Site
My very first site built only with HTML. 
Not the most impressive thing that's graced the Internet with its presence, 
but it's a nice first step on my journey to become a full stack web developer!
The next step for me is to learn CSS, then move on to Bootstrap. Will add
new sites as I progress in my learning!
